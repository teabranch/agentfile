# MCP Token Cost Benchmarks

## Background

A widely-cited article by Jannik Reinhard argues that MCP servers are "context hogs" — the GitHub MCP server (93 tools) costs ~55,000 tokens, and an enterprise stack can exceed 150,000 tokens. CLI tools cost 0 tokens since models know them from training data. The article shows a 35x token reduction for CLI over MCP.

**Agentfile agents are fundamentally different.** They expose 6-15 focused tools per agent, not 93 platform-wide tools. Each agent has a single domain with a small, purpose-built toolset. This page documents our methodology for measuring and proving this difference.

## What Agentfile Measures Differently

The article measures platform-wrapper MCP servers: GitHub (93 tools), Jira, Confluence, etc. These are designed to expose an entire platform's API surface as MCP tools.

Agentfile agents follow a different pattern:
- **Focused domain**: each agent does one thing well (Go development, code review, debugging)
- **Small toolset**: 6-15 tools per agent, matching the task at hand
- **System prompt**: a structured prompt tailored to the domain (~800-2,000 tokens live)
- **Multiple agents**: if you need more capabilities, add another focused agent

This is the "Unix philosophy" applied to MCP: small, composable agents rather than monolithic tool servers.

## Methodology

### Token Estimation

We provide three token counting methods, validated against each other:

1. **bytes/4 heuristic** (`BytesEstimator`): fast, dependency-free, consistent for relative comparisons. Underestimates Claude's actual token count by ~31%.

2. **BPE tokenizer** (`BPECounter`): uses tiktoken's `cl100k_base` encoding (GPT-4's tokenizer). Underestimates Claude's actual token count by ~67% — Claude's tokenizer produces significantly more tokens than GPT-4's for the same input.

3. **Anthropic count_tokens API** (`AnthropicClient`): calls Claude's actual tokenizer via the free `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` endpoint. Zero inference cost. This is ground truth.

Live validation revealed that both offline estimators underestimate Claude's real token counts. The bytes/4 heuristic is actually the closer proxy (31% under vs 67% under for BPE). All results below include live-validated numbers where available.

### What We Measure

1. **Tool schema overhead**: each tool registered via MCP has a JSON schema (name, description, input parameters). We serialize tools as MCP JSON and count bytes/tokens.

2. **System prompt overhead**: the agent's system prompt delivered via `ServerOptions.Instructions` during the MCP handshake.

3. **Total context budget**: schema + prompt as a percentage of the 128K context window.

### Measurement Methods

- **Unit benchmarks** (`benchmarks/`): use in-memory MCP transport (`gomcp.NewInMemoryTransports()`) to capture exactly what the protocol sends, with no subprocess overhead.

- **Integration benchmarks** (`internal/integration/bench_test.go`): build real agent binaries, connect via `gomcp.CommandTransport`, and measure actual wire cost.

- **Synthetic scaling**: generate tool registries at varying sizes (6, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 93) with realistic schemas matching builtin tool complexity (~170 bytes/tool average).

## Results

Run `make bench-report` to generate current numbers.

### Scaling Curve

Tool schema tokens grow linearly with tool count (~333 bytes/tool for focused agents):

```
Focused-agent tools (Agentfile-style, 2-3 params):
   6 tools:    477 tokens  (0.4% of 128K)
  10 tools:    836 tokens  (0.7% of 128K)
  15 tools:  1,254 tokens  (1.0% of 128K)  <- recommended max
  93 tools:  7,762 tokens  (6.1% of 128K)

Platform-wrapper tools (GitHub MCP-style, 5-10 params):
   6 tools:  1,999 tokens  (1.6% of 128K)
  10 tools:  3,252 tokens  (2.5% of 128K)
  93 tools: 30,328 tokens (23.7% of 128K)
```

Platform tools average ~1,300 bytes/tool (3.9x larger than focused tools).

### Tokenizer Comparison (Live-Validated)

Live validation against Claude's actual tokenizer via the count_tokens API revealed that **both offline estimators underestimate**:

```
Community agents (avg across 5 agents, tools + prompt):
  Estimator          Avg tokens    vs Live
  bytes/4 heuristic      1,497     underestimates by 31%
  cl100k_base (BPE)      1,184     underestimates by 67%
  Claude (live)          1,979     ground truth
```

Per-agent live measurements:

```
Agent                    Live    Heuristic    BPE    Live/Heur  Live/BPE
cli-developer           1,937       1,460  1,158        1.33      1.67
code-reviewer           1,884       1,412  1,112        1.33      1.69
debugger                2,010       1,533  1,210        1.31      1.66
golang-pro              2,117       1,668  1,306        1.27      1.62
performance-engineer    1,948       1,463  1,135        1.33      1.72
```

Key insight: GPT-4's cl100k_base tokenizer is a **poor proxy** for Claude's tokenizer. Claude produces ~67% more tokens for the same input. The bytes/4 heuristic (31% under) is paradoxically the better estimator.

### Multi-Turn Cost Projection

Tool definitions are resent with every Claude API request. Over a 20-turn conversation:

```
Configuration                          Per-turn     1t        5t       10t       20t       50t
GitHub MCP (93 tools, article)          55000T    55000T   275000T   550000T  1100000T  2750000T
Agentfile (10 tools + prompt)            1681T     1681T     8405T    16810T    33620T    84050T

Savings (cumulative tokens avoided):
  Reduction                             53319T    53319T   266595T   533190T  1066380T  2665950T
  Ratio                                    33x       33x       33x       33x       33x       33x
```

Over 20 turns: GitHub MCP costs 1,100,000T cumulative. Agentfile costs 33,620T. **33x reduction.**

### Claude Code Baseline Analysis

Claude Code itself consumes context before any MCP servers are loaded. These are manual estimates from session transcripts — not live-validated (we can't send Claude Code's internal tool schemas to count_tokens). The bytes/4 heuristic underestimates by ~31%, so actual baseline is likely higher.

```
Claude Code system prompt: ~3,500 tokens (estimated)
Claude Code built-in tools (23): ~5,700 tokens (estimated)
Total baseline: ~9,200 tokens (7.2% of 128K, estimated)
Likely actual (×1.31): ~12,000 tokens (9.4% of 128K)

Marginal cost of adding agents (live-validated):
  Single Agentfile agent   ~1,937 tokens (1.5% of 128K, live)
  5 community agents       ~9,896 tokens (7.7% of 128K, live)
  GitHub MCP (93 tools)   ~55,000 tokens (43% of 128K, article)
```

A focused Agentfile agent adds ~1,937 tokens (live) — 1.5% of the context window.

### Article Methodology Comparison

Using the calibrated estimator (bytes/4 × 1.31) for comparison. Note: BPE (cl100k_base) was previously used here but live validation showed it underestimates Claude's tokenizer by 67%, making it less accurate than the calibrated heuristic.

```
Article: GitHub MCP (93 tools) = ~55,000 tokens
Our platform-style (93 tools)  = ~25,004 tokens (BPE) / ~39,729 tokens (calibrated)
Our focused-style (10 tools)   = ~686 tokens (BPE) / ~1,095 tokens (calibrated)

Focused 10-tool agent vs article's 93-tool server: 50x smaller (calibrated)
```

The gap between our platform-style generation and the article's measurement (~55K) is because real GitHub MCP schemas have deeper nesting, more enums, and longer descriptions than our synthetic versions.

## The 50-Tool Anti-Pattern

50+ tools per agent IS an anti-pattern. The data shows why:

- At 50 tools, schema alone consumes ~7% of the context window
- Add a system prompt and you're approaching 10%
- Stack multiple such servers and you've consumed the entire context

If you need 50 tools, you need multiple agents. Each agent should have:
- A focused domain (one area of expertise)
- 6-15 tools maximum
- A system prompt tailored to its domain

## Design Principle

**One agent, one domain, 6-15 tools max.**

This keeps each agent under 5% of the context budget, leaving 95%+ for actual conversation and reasoning. Even loading 5 focused agents simultaneously stays under 25% — far below the 43% consumed by a single GitHub MCP server.

The multi-turn analysis makes this even more compelling: over a typical 20-turn coding session, the cumulative token cost difference between a focused agent and a platform MCP server is over 1 million tokens.

## Skills vs Sub-agents vs Agentfile

The industry has converged on two dominant patterns for extending Claude Code: **Agent Skills** (Anthropic's progressive disclosure pattern, launched Dec 2025) and **Sub-agents** (separate context windows via the Agent tool). Agentfile occupies a different point in the design space.

### Three-Way Cost Model (Live-Validated)

Each approach has a fundamentally different cost structure per API turn. Live validation via Claude's count_tokens API confirms the ranking and provides exact numbers:

- **Agent Skills**: loaded prompt tokens (text in context, no tool schemas). Progressive disclosure means only active skills pay full cost.
- **Sub-agents**: baseline + tools + prompt per invocation. Each call opens a separate context window and re-pays Claude Code's full overhead.
- **Agentfile**: tools + prompt as marginal tokens on the existing context window. Same API call, no baseline re-payment.

```
Per-turn/per-call cost (cli-developer, 6 tools):
                    Estimated     Live (count_tokens)
  Agent Skills:     ~3,000T       816T
  Sub-agents:       ~10,600T      6,688T
  Agentfile:        ~1,460T       1,937T
```

### Feature Comparison Matrix

```
Feature                         Skills          Sub-agents      Agentfile
------------------------------  --------------  --------------  --------------
Context cost (live)             816T loaded     6,688T/call     1,937T marginal

```

### Measured Results (Live-Validated)

Using a real community agent (cli-developer, 6 tools) measured with Claude's actual tokenizer:

**Skills comparison**: A loaded skill costs **816T** (live) — much cheaper than our 3,000T estimate, which was based on Anthropic's blog post examples rather than our actual agent prompts. Agentfile costs **1,937T** (live), or **2.4x** a loaded skill. The trade-off: for 2.4x the token cost, you get executable tools, persistent memory, semantic versioning, and one-command distribution.

**Sub-agent comparison**: Sub-agents cost **3.5x** Agentfile per invocation (6,688T vs 1,937T, live). The gap comes from re-paying Claude Code's baseline tools on every call.

```
Sub-agent vs Agentfile cumulative cost (live):
  Invocations         1          3          5         10         20
  Sub-agent       6,688T    20,064T    33,440T    66,880T   133,760T
  Agentfile       1,937T     5,811T     9,685T    19,370T    38,740T
  Ratio             3.5x       3.5x       3.5x       3.5x       3.5x
```

### What the estimates got wrong

Live validation corrected several assumptions in our offline estimates:

1. **Skill cost was 3.7x overestimated** (3,000T estimated vs 816T live). Our estimate came from Anthropic's blog post examples of typical skill prompts. The actual community agents have shorter prompts.

2. **Sub-agent baseline was ~37% overestimated** (10,660T estimated vs 6,688T live). Our synthetic baseline tools generated descriptions sized to approximate token counts, but Claude's tokenizer handles them more efficiently than the bytes/4 heuristic predicted.

3. **Agentfile cost was 33% underestimated** (1,460T estimated vs 1,937T live). The bytes/4 heuristic consistently underestimates Claude's tokenizer.

4. **The ranking holds**: Skill (816T) < Agentfile (1,937T) < Sub-agent (6,688T). The ratios changed but the conclusion is the same — Agentfile is the cheapest option that provides executable tools.

### Why Agentfile Is the Sweet Spot

Agent Skills are the lightest option at 816T — markdown files with progressive disclosure, ideal for context-only instructions without tools or memory.

Sub-agents provide context isolation but cost 6,688T per invocation — 3.5x Agentfile's cost due to re-paying Claude Code's baseline on every call.

Agentfile sits in the middle at 1,937T: executable tools, persistent memory, and versioned distribution at 2.4x the cost of a pure skill. For repeated use over a session, the cumulative savings over sub-agents are substantial (38,740T vs 133,760T over 20 invocations).

These are not mutually exclusive. An Agentfile agent can coexist with skills in the same project, and sub-agents can invoke Agentfile agents' MCP tools.

## Live Validation

We validate all offline estimates against Claude's actual tokenizer using the free `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` API endpoint. No inference cost — just exact token counts.

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... go test -run TestLive -v ./benchmarks/
```

Tests skip gracefully without the key.

### Results

**Estimator accuracy** (averaged across 5 community agents):

| Estimator | Avg error | Direction |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| bytes/4 heuristic | 31% | underestimates |
| cl100k_base (BPE) | 67% | underestimates |

**Three-way cost validation** (cli-developer, 6 tools):

| Approach | Live tokens | Our estimate | Error |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Skill (prompt only) | 816 | 3,000 | 3.7x over |
| Agentfile (tools + prompt) | 1,937 | 1,460 | 33% under |
| Sub-agent (baseline + agent) | 6,688 | 10,660 | 37% over |

**Ranking confirmed**: Agentfile (1,937T) costs 3.5x less than sub-agents (6,688T) per invocation.

### What each test measures

- **TestLiveAgentfileTokenCount**: exact token count for a community agent vs heuristic/BPE estimates
- **TestLiveSubAgentTokenCount**: full sub-agent invocation cost (baseline + agent tools + prompt)
- **TestLiveThreeWayValidation**: all three configurations measured, ranking verified
- **TestLiveCalibration**: all 5 community agents, average correction factors computed

### Manual Claude Code Reproduction

Claude Code doesn't expose per-request token counts (see [issue #6308](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6308)). To inspect MCP handshake overhead manually:

```bash
